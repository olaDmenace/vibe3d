## In Progress
- (none)

## Blocked / Deferred
- shadcn/ui not yet installed — using plain Tailwind for now.
- FBX export: no reliable client-side FBX exporter exists for Three.js — deferred indefinitely.
- Free tier export format restriction: free users should only see GLB (other formats greyed out with upgrade prompt) — not yet enforced in UI.
- View-only permission enforcement: view-only shared users should not be able to use transform tools or generate models — not yet enforced.
- Cron job for auto-purging trashed projects older than 30 days — not yet implemented.

## Decisions & Notes
- Used Lucide React icons for editor toolbar since Figma MCP was initially rate-limited. Icons are centralized for easy swap.
- Used dark theme color palette as CSS custom properties in `globals.css`.
- Sign-in page uses warm earth tones from Figma: #101010 bg, #141413 card, #c2c0b6 title, #faf9f5 button.
- Supabase project ID: `ayhbxyyyzwutsjstradu`, region: `us-east-1`, org: `Kreos`.
- Email auth uses magic link (OTP) rather than password — simpler UX, no password storage.
- Auto-save uses `navigator.sendBeacon` on `beforeunload` for reliable save-on-close.
- AI chat uses Claude claude-sonnet-4-6 for scene manipulation. System prompt includes full scene context + EditorAction schema.
- AI actions are validated before dispatch: object ID existence, numeric bounds, material value clamping.
- Generation prompt normalization (lowercase + trim + collapse whitespace) enables exact-match caching via `assets.ai_prompt`.
- Billing cycle reset is checked on each generation request (monthly rolling window).
- Chat history is stored in `ai_conversations` table, trimmed to last 100 messages.
- Generation requests that match a cached `ai_prompt` in the `assets` table skip the Meshy API call entirely.
- Zod validation added to all API routes. Schemas centralized in `src/lib/api/validation.ts`.
- All API errors use standardized `{ error, code, details }` format via `apiError()` helper.
- Whop SDK (`@whop/sdk`) used for billing. `Whop` class (default export), not `WhopServerSdk`. Checkout via `checkoutConfigurations.create()`, webhook verification via `webhooks.unwrap()`.
- Whop plan IDs are placeholders (`plan_STANDARD_MONTHLY` etc.) — must be replaced with actual IDs from Whop dashboard before launch.
- Whop webhook handler uses Supabase service role client (no user context available in webhooks).
- Export supports GLB (GLTFExporter), OBJ (OBJExporter), STL (STLExporter). FBX deferred — no reliable client-side exporter.
- Non-primitive models loaded during export via GLTFLoader.parse() from `obj.metadata.modelUrl` signed URLs.
- GLB export builds a Three.js scene from store data (no Canvas/R3F context needed), exports via GLTFExporter, and disposes resources after.
- Visual watermark for free tier: CanvasTexture with text rendered on a PlaneGeometry, semi-transparent, added to the export scene root.
- Asset uploads validated for MIME type + extension fallback + 50MB size limit. Storage path: `{userId}/{projectId}/{assetId}.{ext}`.
- Free tier enforced at project creation time by checking `profiles.plan` + counting existing projects vs `PLAN_CONFIGS.projectLimit`.
- Soft deletes: DELETE /api/projects/[id] sets `deleted_at` timestamp instead of removing the row. All list/get queries filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`.
- Free tier project count excludes soft-deleted projects (they don't count against the limit).
- Sharing uses `get_user_id_by_email` RPC (SECURITY DEFINER) to look up users by email without exposing `auth.users`.
- Database migrations tracked in `supabase/migrations/` — 3 files covering soft deletes, sharing RLS, and user lookup RPC.
- Pagination defaults: page=1, limit=20, max limit=100. Response includes `{ data, shared, pagination: { page, limit, total, pages } }`.

## Known Issues
- THREE.js warnings in console: "THREE.Clock: This module has been deprecated" and "PCFSoftShadowMap has been removed" — cosmetic, from drei/three version mismatch.
- Pre-existing lint errors in `transform-gizmo.tsx` — refs accessed during render (React 19 strict mode warning).
